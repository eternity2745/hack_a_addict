#NavaJeev
This app was made for Hack-A-Addict competition which aimed at building apps targeted at anti-drug addiction. 

NavaJeev has features such as reporting an incident, searching for nearby rehabs, ai assistant, quiz games for engaging youth.

This project has another part for authorities which comes as a separate app to be distributed among police officers. The police officers can view incidents reported within the range of their respective police stations. By using this strategy police officers will be able to tackle incidents more actively and will help in reducing drug addiction among the youth.
